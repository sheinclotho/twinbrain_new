    System-level graph propagation for predictions.

    After the per-node temporal predictor generates initial predictions
    ``{node_type: [N, pred_steps, H]}``, this module propagates them
    through the brain's connectivity graph so that a change in one brain
    region's predicted activity influences all its connected neighbours.

    Neuroscientific motivation
    --------------------------
    The brain operates as a **coupled dynamical system**.  Stimulating
    region A (or altering its activity) does not affect A in isolation —
    the perturbation propagates via white-matter tracts (structural
    connectivity) and correlated activity (functional connectivity) to
    regions B, C, D, …  Without this module the predictor treats every
    node independently, so stimulating a single ROI only alters that
    ROI's trajectory.  With this module the prediction becomes a
    system-level forecast: changed activity at A ripples through the
    graph to its neighbours in proportion to their edge weights.

    Architecture
    ------------
    ``num_prop_layers`` rounds of ST-GCN message passing applied to the
    prediction tensor ``[N, pred_steps, H]``, treating ``pred_steps`` as
    the temporal dimension (analogous to ``T`` in the encoder).  The
    same edge connectivity used during encoding is reused here, so the
    propagator is consistent with the learned representations.
    Residual connections + LayerNorm keep gradients healthy.

        """InfoNCE / Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) loss.

        Forces the predictor to produce *discriminative* latent representations
        that uniquely identify the correct future timestep, rather than predicting
        the unconditional mean of the future distribution.

        Why this matters for pred_r2:
          Pure regression (Huber / MSE) can be minimised by predicting a smooth
          average of plausible futures, which yields low MSE but negative R² (worse
          than predicting the global mean).  InfoNCE requires the predictor to
          distinguish the correct future (positive) from all other timesteps
          (negatives), which is only possible if the predicted representation
          carries unique information about that specific future window.
          This is the same principle as CPC (Oord 2018), wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski 2020),
          and CLIP (Radford 2021): contrastive discrimination forces the model to
          capture the *what* of future states, not just the *expected average*.

        Scientific basis:
          The brain exhibits a rich structure of temporal sequences; even brief
          windows of EEG / fMRI carry unique spectro-spatial fingerprints that
          distinguish them from other windows in the same session (Stringer et al.
          2019, Nature; Engemann et al. 2022, NeuroImage).  InfoNCE exploits this
          structure as a training signal.

        Implementation:
          Flatten (node, step) pairs to [N*S, H]; L2-normalise; compute cosine
          similarity matrix [N*S, N*S] / τ; positives are on the diagonal.
          Symmetric bidirectional cross-entropy (pred→target and target→pred) as
          in CLIP for additional stability.

                suppression of pred_sig).  1.0 = V5.50 recommended value for

                The encoder and decoder are still trained through the prediction
                path (pred_sig_loss → decoder → predictor), so disabling

        This is the core **digital twin** capability: ask "what-if" questions
        about the brain without running an actual experiment.  It mirrors TMS
        (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) experiments:
          1. Encode the baseline brain state → h [N, T, H]

        Systematically perturbs each brain region and measures the causal propagated

            Luo et al. (2025) "Mapping effective connectivity by virtually perturbing
            a surrogate brain." *Nature Methods*.

        Algorithm:
            For each source region i ∈ [0, N):
                1. Encode baseline brain state → h [N, T, H]
                2. Apply unit perturbation at region i:
                   h_pert[i] += direction_i × strength × std(h[i])
                3. Predict perturbed and baseline futures; propagate through graph
                4. Decode to signal space; compute causal effect = perturbed − baseline
                5. EC[:, i] = mean-abs causal effect across time at each region

        Compared to NPI (fMRI-only RNN), TwinBrain's EC mapping offers:
          • Graph-native encoding (preserves small-world topology)
          • Multi-modal: can compute EEG-EC, fMRI-EC, and cross-modal EEG→fMRI EC
          • Subject-specific: personalized via subject_embed

        Args:
            data: HeteroData brain state window (a single time window).
            modality: Node type to perturb and measure ('fmri' or 'eeg').
            perturbation_strength: Perturbation amplitude in units of the node's
                latent standard deviation.  1.0 = 1 σ (physiologically mild),
                2.0 = 2 σ (supraphysiological, as in strong TMS).
            signed: If True, return signed EC (positive = excitatory, negative =
                inhibitory, based on net mean causal effect direction).
                If False, return absolute EC magnitude only.
            normalize: Normalize EC matrix to [0, 1] by dividing by max absolute value.
            batch_size: Number of regions to perturb in parallel.  Higher values
                use more memory but are faster on GPU.

        Returns:
            ec_matrix: Float tensor [N, N].
                ec_matrix[j, i] = causal influence of region i on region j.
                Row j = "who influences j?"; Column i = "where does i project to?".

        ----------------
        1. Reconstruction R² (r2_<node_type>):
           How well the model reconstructs the input signal.
           R² = 1 − SS_res/SS_tot.  R² = 1 → perfect; R² = 0 → mean baseline;
           R² < 0 → worse than mean baseline (failure).

        2. Signal-space prediction R² (pred_r2_<node_type>):
           **Primary quality indicator** — how well the model predicts future
           brain signals from past signals.
           Procedure:
           a) Slice raw signal to T_ctx steps (context only).
           b) Re-encode the context-only slice through the full encoder.
              This is the TRULY CAUSAL encoding: the encoder cannot see any
              signal beyond T_ctx, regardless of its bidirectional structure.
           c) Run predictor on causal context latent → predicted latent.
           d) Decode to signal space → predicted signal.
           e) Compare against raw future signal [T_ctx:T_ctx+pred_steps].
           This is the real "digital-twin" capability metric — measured without
           any future information leakage from the bidirectional encoder.

        Freezes all model parameters **except** ``model.subject_embed.weight[subject_idx]``
        and runs ``num_steps`` gradient descent steps minimising the reconstruction loss.
        This is extremely parameter-efficient: only H parameters (e.g. 128) are updated,
        making personalisation feasible with as few as 10–50 training windows.

        Scientific motivation: the encoder has already learned the shared functional
        connectivity structure from training subjects.  A new subject's brain differs
        mainly in its baseline activity level and connection-strength offsets — captured
        by the subject embedding without altering shared topology knowledge.

        Use this after training on multiple subjects to quickly adapt the model to a
        new subject at inference time, without re-training the full model.

        Args:
            data_list: Windows from the new subject.  As few as 10–50 windows
                (~20–100 TR of fMRI, or ~40 s of EEG) typically suffice.
            subject_idx: Integer index in ``model.subject_embed``.
                Must be < ``model.num_subjects``.  Allocate an unused index
                (e.g. ``num_subjects`` + 1) for a genuinely new subject,
                or reuse an existing index to override that subject's embedding.
            num_steps: Gradient descent steps (default 100).
            lr: Learning rate for the embedding update.  Default 5e-3 is
                higher than the main training LR (1e-4) because only H
                parameters are updated — the optimisation landscape is well-
