# TwinBrain V5 - Complete Graph-Native Reimagination

## 🎯 Philosophy Shift

### From: Hybrid Graph-Sequence System
```
Brain Data → Graph → Sequences → Process → Graph → Sequences → Output
                ↑                                      ↑
            Unnecessary conversion            Another conversion
```

### To: Pure Graph-Native System
```
Brain Data → Graph → Process on Graph → Output
                ↑                   
         Stay on graph throughout!
```

---

## 🌟 What's New?

This isn't just optimization - it's a **complete reimagination** of the training pipeline that:

1. **Keeps Brain as Graph** - No graph→sequence→graph conversions
2. **Native Small-World Modeling** - Leverages brain's inherent network structure
3. **Spatial-Temporal on Graphs** - Processes time series directly on graph structure
4. **Maximum Interpretability** - Graph structure = brain structure throughout

---

## 📦 Complete System Components

### 1. Graph-Native Mapper (`graph_native_mapper.py`)

**Problem it solves**: Current system builds graphs then breaks them back to sequences.

**New approach**:
```python
class GraphNativeBrainMapper:
    """
    Build graph ONCE and KEEP IT throughout pipeline.
    
    - fMRI: [N_rois, T_time] → Graph with temporal node features
    - EEG: [N_channels, T_time] → Graph with temporal node features
    - Cross-modal edges between EEG and fMRI nodes
    """
```

**Key features**:
- Builds connectivity-based graph structure (small-world)
- Preserves temporal signals as node features [N, T, C]
- No flattening or sequence conversion
- Support for anatomical + functional connectivity

**Usage**:
```python
mapper = GraphNativeBrainMapper(atlas_name='schaefer200')

# Map fMRI to graph (temporal features preserved)
fmri_graph = mapper.map_fmri_to_graph(
    timeseries=fmri_data,  # [N_rois, T_time]
    connectivity_matrix=fc_matrix,  # [N_rois, N_rois]
)

# Map EEG to graph
eeg_graph = mapper.map_eeg_to_graph(
    timeseries=eeg_data,  # [N_channels, T_time]
    channel_names=ch_names,
)

# Add cross-modal connections
full_graph = mapper.create_cross_modal_edges(
    combined_graph,
    eeg_to_fmri_mapping=mapping_dict,
)
```

---

### 2. Graph-Native Encoder (`graph_native_encoder.py`)

**Problem it solves**: Current encoder converts graph to sequences for processing.

**New approach**: **Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution (ST-GCN)**

```python
class SpatialTemporalGraphConv:
    """
    Process temporal signals ON the graph.
    
    1. Temporal convolution (along time axis)
    2. Spatial message passing (along graph edges)
    3. Attention for adaptive aggregation
    """
```

**Architecture**:
```
Input: Graph with features [N, T, C]
   ↓
ST-GCN Layer 1: Spatial-Temporal Convolution
   ↓
ST-GCN Layer 2: With attention
   ↓
ST-GCN Layer 3: With attention
   ↓
ST-GCN Layer 4: With attention
   ↓
Temporal Attention: Long-range dependencies
   ↓
Output: Encoded graph [N, T, H]
```

**Key innovations**:
- **ST-GCN**: Combines spatial (graph) and temporal (time) convolutions
- **Temporal Attention**: Multi-head attention across time dimension
- **Heterogeneous**: Handles multiple node types (fMRI, EEG)
- **No sequence conversion**: Pure graph operations

**Usage**:
```python
encoder = GraphNativeEncoder(
    node_types=['fmri', 'eeg'],
    edge_types=[
        ('fmri', 'connects', 'fmri'),
        ('eeg', 'connects', 'eeg'),
        ('eeg', 'projects_to', 'fmri'),
    ],
    in_channels_dict={'fmri': 1, 'eeg': 1},
    hidden_channels=128,
    num_layers=4,
)

# Encode (no conversion needed!)
encoded_graph = encoder(input_graph)
# Still has temporal features: [N, T, H]
```

---

### 3. Complete Training System (`graph_native_system.py`)

**Full end-to-end pipeline**:

```python
class GraphNativeBrainModel:
    """
    Complete model: Encoder → Predictor → Decoder
    
    All operations ON GRAPH, no conversions!
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.encoder = GraphNativeEncoder(...)
        self.predictor = EnhancedMultiStepPredictor(...)
        self.decoder = GraphNativeDecoder(...)
```

**Training system**:
```python
class GraphNativeTrainer:
    """
    Integrated trainer with:
    - Graph-native model
    - Adaptive loss balancing (V5)
    - EEG channel enhancement (V5)
    - Advanced prediction (V5)
    """
```

## 🔄 Comparison: Old vs New

### Old System (Current)

```python
# 1. Build graph in mapper
graph = build_graph(fmri_data)
edge_index = graph.edge_index

# 2. Extract sequences from graph
x_seq = extract_node_sequences(graph)  # [N, T, F]

# 3. Process sequences (graph info lost!)
encoded = encoder(x_seq)  # Treats as independent sequences

# 4. Rebuild graph structure
graph.x = pool_temporal(encoded)  # [N, F]
graph.edge_index = edge_index  # Re-add edges

# 5. GNN on static features
output = gnn(graph.x, graph.edge_index)
```

**Problems**:
- Graph built → broken → rebuilt (inefficient)
- Temporal info processed separately from spatial
- Graph structure not used during temporal modeling

### New System (V5)

```python
# 1. Build graph with temporal features
graph = mapper.map_fmri_to_graph(fmri_data)
# graph['fmri'].x = [N, T, 1]
# graph['fmri', 'connects', 'fmri'].edge_index = [2, E]

# 2. Process DIRECTLY on graph
encoded_graph = encoder(graph)
# Still: [N, T, H] with graph structure preserved!

# 3. Predict future on graph
predicted_graph = predictor(encoded_graph)

# 4. Decode from graph
reconstructed = decoder(encoded_graph)
```

**Advantages**:
- Graph structure preserved throughout
- Spatial and temporal processed together
- More efficient (no conversions)
- More interpretable (graph = brain)

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution

**Mathematical formulation**:

```
# For each node i at time t:
h_i^(t) = σ(
    Temporal_Conv(x_i) +                    # Process time series
    Σ_{j∈N(i)} α_ij * W * h_j^(t)          # Aggregate from neighbors
)

where:
- N(i): neighbors of node i in graph
- α_ij: attention weight between i and j
- W: learnable weights
```

**Key properties**:
1. **Spatial awareness**: Uses graph structure for message passing
2. **Temporal modeling**: Conv1D along time axis
3. **Adaptive**: Attention weights learn importance
4. **Efficient**: Processes all timesteps in parallel

### Temporal Attention

```python
# Multi-head attention across time dimension
Q = h @ W_q  # [N, T, H] → [N, T, H]
K = h @ W_k
V = h @ W_v

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d) V
```

**Benefits**:
- Long-range temporal dependencies
- Learn which timepoints are important
- Complement to local temporal convolution

    eeg_to_fmri_mapping=mapping_dict,
    distance_threshold=30.0,  # mm
)
```

**Benefits**:

    ('fmri', 'connects', 'fmri'): STGCNConv(...),
    ('eeg', 'connects', 'eeg'): STGCNConv(...),
    ('eeg', 'projects_to', 'fmri'): STGCNConv(...),
})
```

**Advantages**:

## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

### Graph Signal Processing

Temporal signals on graphs as **graph signals**:
```
X: V × T → ℝ
where V = graph nodes, T = time points
```

**ST-GCN** implements graph signal filtering:
```
H^(l+1) = σ(D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) H^(l) W^(l) ⊗ K)
          ↑                              ↑
    Graph Laplacian             Temporal kernel
```

### Small-World Networks

Brain connectivity follows **small-world** properties:
- High clustering coefficient
- Short average path length
- Hub nodes (important brain regions)

Our mapper **preserves** these properties:
```python
k_nearest=20  # Maintains local clustering
threshold=0.3  # Keeps long-range connections
```
